### Abstract

This proposal introduces an original music system inspired by the topology of the Petersen graph and integrating the Chinese Five Elements (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) together with Yin–Yang polarity. The result is a non-linear tuning framework that departs from 12-TET. The core design comprises 15 directional scale positions (5 elements × 3 polarities), extendable to 45 notes (3 registers × 15 positions). Melodies are generated by graph-constrained walks and scaled using the golden ratio. The system emphasizes rule-driven harmonic exploration and has potential to generate novel yet pleasant-sounding music. This report discusses theoretical foundations, innovations, feasibility, and applications to support future project proposal work (no experimental data included).

### Introduction

Conventional music systems rely heavily on 12-TET; while equal temperament simplifies modulation, it sacrifices pure harmonic ratios and produces tuning deviations. Inspired by the Petersen graph (3-regular, 10 nodes), this system explores a hybrid geometric-and-philosophical framework: graph topology acts as an interval constraint and the Five Elements plus Yin–Yang polarity generate a non-linear scale. The Five Elements' productive and controlling cycles serve as symbolic mappings for musical generation and emotional mapping, potentially useful in music therapy and expressive composition. This proposal aims to reconceptualize a Petersen-based music system and evaluate its potential to produce harmonious music.

### System Overview

#### Core framework

- Based on the Petersen graph, define 15 directional scale positions: the five elements are placed around a circle at angles Metal 0°, Wood 72°, Water 144°, Fire 216°, Earth 288°, and each element has three polarities (Yin -1, Neutral 0, Yang +1).
- A Yin–Yang offset parameter Δθ (default 5°) is used to adjust angles: θ = θ0 + Δθ · p (p ∈ {-1, 0, 1}).
- Pitch ratios use a golden-ratio-based scaling: ρ = φ^(θ/72), where φ ≈ 1.618. Reference frequency F0 = 220 Hz; results are folded into the single-octave range [220, 440] Hz to preserve listening comfort.
- The Petersen graph's undirected edges (30 edges, equivalent to 60 directed transitions) define the melodic grammar: melodies are produced by walks along adjacent nodes, creating a "constrained freedom" compositional mechanism.
- The Five Elements map to timbre and affect (for example: Metal = bell-like/steady, Water = glissando/fluid); Yin–Yang modulation affects timbral brightness (Yang-leaning brighter harmonics, Yin-leaning darker filtering).


#### Yin–Yang offset parameter (default 5°)

- Recommended default: Δθ = 5° (used as the system starting point).
- Rationale summary:
  - A 5° microtonal offset corresponds to approximately 116 cents, providing a subtle microtonal distinction between Yin and Yang that favors gentle microtonal effects rather than abrupt jumps.
  - Compared with a previously considered 10° offset (≈231 cents), 5° reduces dissonance risk while preserving a 72° base separation (≈833 cents) between elements to maintain element distinctness.
  - The choice of 5° resonates conceptually with irrational angular heuristics (e.g., golden angle 137.5°) while being musically tempered toward perceptual preferences—helpful to approach natural harmonic series and listener acceptance.
- Tunability and experimental suggestions:
  - Keep the parameter adjustable (e.g., try 18° to explore "golden-scale" patterns); defaulting to 5° prioritizes listenability for prototypes and demonstrations.
  - Suggest evaluating Δθ impact via MIDI output and listening tests, and combine path weighting and harmony-priority strategies to tune parameters.

This setting aims to increase musical viability and make it easier to generate more "pleasant" prototypes (see microtonal practitioners like Sevish for reference).

If numerical simulation or example MIDI is desired, run parameter sweeps and subjective listening evaluations.

#### Extension to 45 notes

- Using a three-ring interpretation of the Petersen-inspired layout—inner, middle, and outer rings corresponding to low/mid/high registers—apply frequency multipliers 1/φ, 1, and φ to replicate the 15 positions into 45 notes.
- The system is not a static keyboard but a dynamic network: melodies may move between rings to create hierarchical narratives (e.g., from the deep, low ring to the bright, high ring).


### Innovations and Theoretical Basis

#### Rule-driven vs. data-driven

- This system is rule-driven: it can generate music without extensive training data by using golden-ratio-based intervals and graph constraints to reduce jarring jumps.
- Unlike deep-learning-based generative models (e.g., MusicGen), this system emphasizes interpretable rules and a clear musical grammar.

#### Non-octave-cycle potential

- Optionally adopt a "golden octave" (ratio φ:1, ≈833 cents) instead of the conventional 2:1 octave to create a non-periodic, evolving perceptual field. This idea is analogous to other experimental non-octave scales (e.g., Bohlen–Pierce).

#### Integration of Five Elements and Yin–Yang

- Map the Five Elements' productive/controlling relations onto melodic generation rules (for example, "Wood generates Fire" or "Fire controls Metal"), influencing melodic direction and harmonic behavior.
- Adjust Yin–Yang parameters to explore "balanced" musical states and emotional expression.


### Feasibility Analysis

#### Harmonic potential

- Golden-ratio-based tuning, in certain configurations, can approximate pure harmonic relationships; combined with graph constraints, the system may produce organic and pleasing melodies.
- Extending to 45 notes increases harmonic color but requires parameter tuning (e.g., Δθ, priority for harmonic paths) to avoid harsh intervals.

#### Implementation pathway

- A prototype can be implemented in Python plus MIDI/audio synthesis libraries to perform graph walks on the Petersen structure and map positions to golden-ratio frequencies.
- Risks: uneven intervals may produce uncomfortable results. Mitigations include path weighting, harmony-priority algorithms, listening tests, and iterative parameter adjustment.

#### Comparison with 12-TET

- The system sacrifices some modulation freedom typical of 12-TET in exchange for a geometry-and-philosophy-driven harmonic language, suited to experimental composition, therapeutic music, and cross-disciplinary art projects.


### Potential Applications and Extensions

- Music composition: generate "Five-Element narratives" (including therapeutic pieces).
- Cross-disciplinary: sonification, sound art installations, novel performance interfaces, or MPE-compatible synth designs.
- Extensions: integrate with AI prompting tools while preserving the rule core, explore other graph topologies, and add more registers.


### Conclusion and Recommendations

The Petersen music system offers an original and realizable framework that combines graph theory, Five Elements philosophy, and golden-ratio tuning, with potential to generate new, harmonious music. Recommended next steps: build a prototype, run listening tests and parameter optimization, and conduct cross-cultural comparative research. The system is not constrained by existing music theory and can open new paradigms in experimental music.
